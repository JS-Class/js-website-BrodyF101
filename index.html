        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>I was born in Paulding, Ohio and I have lived here my entire life. <br> I am 21 years old.
            Currently I work at the local <em>Ace hardware</em> and have worked there for about 3 years now. 
            <br>
            I live with my girlfriend and our two cats, Mocha and Squid.

            The first cat that we got was Mocha, she is a calico cat which I have heard is rare for 
            females. <br> We got her after a friend of ours had a litter of kittens and we took her in. <br> 
            <span id="squid">Squid was our second cat he is a long haired cat and is very cuddly and is sitting on my lap 
            as I write this.</span><br> We got him after we realised that Mocha was lonely. <br>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

        <p>
            I have a couple of different hobbies, my most prominent being video games. <br>
            I started playing videogames when I was around 6 years old with my cousin. <br>
            We were probably one of the first people to play <em>Minecraft</em>. My second hobby is 
            watching movies. <br> It's a tradition with me and my dad to watch movies together and 
            I have seen so many it's hard to find one I haven't seen. <br> My favorite movie of all 
            time would have to be <strong>Whiplash</strong>. Incase you were interested here are 
            my top five movies of all time. 
            <br>

            <ol>
                <li>Whiplash</li>
                <li>Interstellar</li>
                <li>Fury</li>
                <li>Se7en</li>
                <li>The Green Mile</li>
            </ol>
